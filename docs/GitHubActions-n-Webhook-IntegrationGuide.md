Perfect — let's now create a **dedicated GitHub Actions Documentation Section** that captures all the current webhook use cases, Slack integrations, and CI/CD prep you just outlined.

I'll extend the current canvas with a new block like this:

---

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions & Webhook Integration Guide

This section documents automation workflows that are part of both public and pro editions of `RepoBuilderGPT`. It ensures replicable automation, CI/CD extension potential, and real-time integration with external services such as Slack, Zapier, or Discord.

### 🎯 Purpose

These GitHub Actions serve as:

* Test harnesses for webhook payloads
* Foundation for integrating Slack/Discord/Zapier-based automation
* Launchpads for more complex client CI/CD or serverless deployment hooks

---

### 🧪 Slack Webhook Trigger (Example Action)

#### Overview:

* Manually triggered via GitHub Actions UI
* Sends a test message to a provided Slack webhook URL

#### Sample Slack Payload:

```json
{
  "text": "🚀 RepoBuilderGPT webhook triggered! 🎯 Testing automated pipelines."
}
```

#### Action Snippet:

```yaml
name: 🔔 Send Slack Webhook

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      payload_url:
        description: "Slack Webhook URL"
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  trigger_slack:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 🔔 Send Webhook to Slack
        run: |
          curl -X POST \
               -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
               --data '{"text":"🚀 RepoBuilderGPT webhook triggered! 🎯 Testing automated pipelines."}' \
               "${{ github.event.inputs.payload_url }}"
```

---

### 📦 File-Based Packaging Trigger (Pro Only)

* `zip_engine/build_and_package.py` runs as a post-generation task.
* Output structure includes build manifest, logs, and zipped bundle.
* Can be extended to upload ZIP to a file host, S3 bucket, or email dispatch.
