📢 **Now Live: A Framework for AI-Powered Profit Houses**

Hi LinkedIn 👋

I've just published the **first Medium article** in a new series — built around creating *real-world monetization systems* using GPTs, SEO, and repo automation.

This goes beyond theory. I'm sharing the actual structure I use — both **public and private**, open to contributors, thinkers, and builders alike.

🎯 **What’s inside this system?**

* 🧠 GPT-powered repo generation
* 📦 Structured templates for scalability
* 🔍 SEO-driven article planning + AI-native strategy
* 🧱 Modular tracks for AR/VR, FinTech, and energy-saving product verticals
