# 🚀 Launch Announcement: The Idea Behind `RepoBuilderGPT`

Excited to share the *first article* in my Medium.com series exploring how structured Git repositories and GPT-driven tooling can reshape the way we build, plan, and deliver impactful projects.

💡 This one kicks off with a core idea: **bridging public transparency and private innovation** — especially for domains like ESG, sustainability, fintech, and automation-driven operations.

🛠️ Tooling used:
- GPT config in YAML
- Branch logic for client isolation
- Zip engine for packaging
- SEO & outreach planning
- CLI scripts to automate publishing
